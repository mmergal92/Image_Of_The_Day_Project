#### For this project, I decided to connect to the Metropolitan Museum of Art API. My goal was to link the API and be able to pull the image and information about the works of art from each artist. 

### Some of the challanges I faced during this project:
- the search API and the API where the images were included were 2 different APIs. 
- being able to go through the array and display the images after getting the information from the AJAX call.

### Some stretch goals that I want to work on are: 
- be able to have click a "random" button and pull a random image from an internally selected list of artists
- hover over the image for more information on the work of art
- have a feature where the user can click on a button for more works of art from this particular artists and go through them in a carousel
- when the carousel is over, they can choose another artist (the list they could choose from would be artists with similar genres of art or similar cutural backgrounds).

## Breakdown ##
1. First I researched which APIs would have interesting features to use and found the Metropolitan Museum of Art had an API that was open to the public. 
2. I connected this API and realized that I had to create arrays of Object IDs that held the information to obtain images of the works of art of selected artists.
